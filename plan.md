# Implementation Plan

This document will contain the plan for the implementation of the user story, which you should fill BEFORE you start coding. Replace the placeholder/example text below with your actual plan, while retaining the structure.

## Plan

High-level step by step plan of what you will do. For example:

- Add a new table for chat messages,
- Implement a repo, service and controller for reading and creating chat messages,
- Update the React frontend to allow users to send and view messages,
- ...

## Decisions

The top 2-3 decision you have taken, plus the alternatives and rationale for your choices. For example:

- Decision: Use GitHub Codespaces for the development environment.
  - Alternative: Use a local development environment.
  - Alternative: Use Gitpod for the development environment.
  - Rationale: Setting up a local environment is time-consuming and error-prone. Gitpod "Clasic" (hosted in the cloud) will be sunset on April 2025, and GitHub Codespaces allows leveraging Dev Containers - which can also be used locally if really needed. Hence we select GitHub Codespaces as it's the most future-proof and flexible option.

## Notes

Any additional notes that you think are relevant to the plan. For example, do we need to perform any changes to the AWS architecture to support the new feature? Briefly describe the changes you would need to make.
